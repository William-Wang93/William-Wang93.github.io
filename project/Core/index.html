        <p>When you work long enough in a high growth company, you tend to hear a lot about the concept of <b>"Core Income"</b>, which
             measures the 
            earnings generated from the principal business lines for the company. The reason this concept holds weight at young, fast growing companies
            is that investors are often keen on understanding the true value of these newer, less understood businesses. And to do that, they need to
            understand not only how much money the company makes over a year, but how much of those earnings are <b><em>sustainable and principal to the company</em></b> over the long term.
            <br>
            <br>
            In other words, 
            what's real, and what's noise? What happened this year that's likely to happen next year?
            <br>
            <br>
            I'll give an example. A company might change its inventory valuation method from 
            FIFO to LIFO, and retroactively changes it Cost of Goods Sold 
            in previous years to reflect this change. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In the current year, the company would make an adjusting entry to recognize the gain or loss for the change in the method,
            which would alter Net Income and its cascading domino tiles we call financial ratios that affect how financiers view investments.
            <br>
            <br>
            But this wouldn't be viewed as Core Income for the company. Unless the company was in the business of annually adjusting its accounting policies (which, by the way, would only
            only infuriate its entire accounting team), the adjustment would be supplementary income.
            <br>
            <br>
            With some <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration: underline;">HTML</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">CSS</span>, I"ve created a visualization that walks down Core Income to Supplementary Income, all the way down to Comprehensive Income. Clicking on each box will give an explanation of
            each line item.

        <p>Core Income:</p>
        <!--Core Gross Margin-->
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Core Sales Revenue</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This is the <b>revenue from the main lines of a business</b>. If an apple cider making company listed out it's core income on its income statement, it would be cider making (and ancillary sales of apples).
                It probably wouldn't list its gains on investments of NFTs, however.
            </p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">(-) Core Cost of Sales</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This is the cost of Sales that is incurred to <b>manufacture core goods/deliver services.</b> Back to the cider making company example - You need apples to make cider, your core revenue, so that would be a COGS.</p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="background:#ceecfd"><b>(=) Core Gross Margin</b></button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Core Gross Margin equals the removal of expenses that drive Core Revenue</p>
        </div>
        <!--Core Operating Income from Sales-->
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">(-) Core Operating Expenses</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Core Operating Expenses are expenses related to supporting, but not driving, Core Revenues. In regards to the apple cider making example, these expenses
                would be related to administrative functions to support cider making. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <!--Core Operating Income-->
        <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="background:#ceecfd"><b>(=) Core Operating Income</b></button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Core Operating Income is found by subtracting core operating expenses from Core Gross Margin. To get from Core Operating Income to Comprehensive Income, which shows
                a full reflection of all the financial expenses/income that a business incurs, you have to take into account ancillary items as the ones below.
            </p>
        </div>
        <!--Unusual items-->
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">(-) Inventory Write Downs</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>When Inventory is lost/impaired, companies write them down to reflect the true value of these assets. </p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">(+-) Profits and losses from asset sales</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Selling off assets in closing business lines would be an example of this. For the Apple Cider Business, if you closed a business line to say, foreign apple sales, any assets in that business (inventory, for instance) would be part of this.</p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">(+-) Extraordinary Operating Items</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>These would be related to items that are both unusual and unlikely to reoccur in the future, and not part of the company's day to day operations. Examples include Natural disasters, repayment of debt, and write off of intangible assets.</p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">(+-) Accounting Changes</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>When a company changes how its calculates certain items (FIFO to LIFO for Inventory calculation), those gains/losses will be reflect here.</p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">(+-)  Unrealized Gains and Losses on Equity Investments</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>These refer to value changes in investments (stocks) for instance. If a company bought the stocks of another company to better deploy their cash elsewhere, the change in value there 
                would be reflected here. </p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">(+-) Other </button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>These can refer to EMI investments (Income from 20-50% ownership of a company), currency translation adjustments, etc</p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="background:#ceecfd"><b>(=) Comprehensive Operating Income</b></button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>These comprehensive items, added to Core Operating Income, equals Comprehensive Operating Income.</p>
